# Be_Healthy

Yoga is a way to feel good in your body and mind. It's like stretching and breathing to help you relax and be strong.Our 'Be Healthy' project aims to help people improve their well-being.We're focusing on how food impacts health in our project. Eating fruits, veggies, lean proteins, and whole grains keeps us healthy and energized.Users log in to find health resources easily based on location and preferences. They input details like city, date, and type of resource for tailored options.Our problem is that many people don't realize how important health and wellness are. We'll talk about common health issues people face. Our solution is the 'Be Healthy' project, which helps tackle these challenges. We'll explain how it works and what it does to make staying healthy easier for everyone..Our project is for everyone, no matter their age or background, who wants to be healthier. We're not just focusing on one place; we want to help people all around the world, especially those who might not have easy access to health resources. Everyone is welcome, and we're making sure it's easy for everyone to use.
We're building the project using Spring Boot for the back end, Angular for the front end, and Java for making everything work together. Our data will be stored and managed using MySQL databases, with Visual Studio Code helping us write and organize our code for smoother development.

Be Healthy is a Web based Application where In Frontend side I have used Angular Framwork
-> Angular is a Javascript based frontend framework where I have used the typesript, html, css and bootstrap to build the web page.

In backend side I have used Spring Boot Framework.

it's a Java based framework. Where I have used the Spring Boot 3.0 version. In this I have used the Spring Data JPA for database interaction and for database connectivity I have used spring jdbc connectivity. I have created the Rest API for User Registration, Login, and for getting all the dynamic data for our application.

In Database I have used MySQL database where I have stored the be healthy apps table and all the data.

I have used Spring Tool Suite for backend development.
I have used Visual Studio Code for UI development.
And in database I have used MySQL Workbench to access all the table and column.
